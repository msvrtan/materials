## Talks:
### Promise of a generation

Abstract:

While 'my generation' was promised life on Mars, robots and flying cars by these days, this talk will cover more short-term promises to revolutionize our industry: from NoSQL, blockchain to artificial inteligence as some of the examples.

In this talk we will look at some of successfull and floopped 'revolutionary' ideas in the past, reflect on them and look for patterns, traits and connections to current ones.

### User: design discussion

Abstract:

As an example of software architecture most of us are familiar with: `Users`, lets look at some patterns and pitfalls of them. There is no right answer, as it does depend on your particular use case but idea behind this session is to expand our knowledge beyond 'your mileage may vary' and 'it depends' that have become so often a generic answer to so many questions.

This session is not meant as a talk but as a discussion: it's curcial that you as attendee get involved and help in the discussion: whether it's you asking questions, offering ideas or your use cases and solutions. Initial examples will be prepared by me and I will moderate the discussion to keep it on track and avoid some needless bikeshedding ;)

Key takeaway from this session: share your experiences and learn from other people!


Additional information:

I would love to do this discussion on ZgPHP in May or June of 2019, as 2nd in the series (for now I have only 2 topics for sessions). 


### Naming is hard (discussion)

Abstract:

They say computer science has 2 hard problems: cache invalidation, naming things and off-by-1 errors. In this session we'll cover naming, in a rather unorthodox way: not as a talk, it's meant as a multiway discussion for a smaller group of people (up to 15-20).

In order to start the discussion I have few examples prepared: from method/class or function/module naming to architecture and design patterns. I will moderate the discussion, but depending on the interest of the attendees and amount of time we have, we might not cover all of the examples.

Key takeaway from this session: share your experiences and learn from other people!


Additional information:

I would love to do this discussion on ZgPHP in April of 2019 as 1st in the series (of for now 2 sesssions). I'm firm believer that we all can learn more if we shared our experiences and get into discussion instead of doing a one-way type talk: I'we already done 'Nitpicking terminology' in that way and last year I organized my PHPYorkshire talk slot about 'Being a remote developer' to include a 15min panel to discuss it (as I had extra time)


### Learning from others

Abstract:

As a rather young industry, set on disrupting the world, industry built on life long learning: IT is actually pretty bad in learning from others. For some rather strange reason, we love 'reinventhing the wheel' and dissing 'those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it' ideas.

Some years ago I noticed how much my community (PHP) is reluctant to learn from others: lot of problems we try to solve have been solved for decades in other communities. This is not a trait of my community only, I'we seen it everywhere. 

However, this talk will focus more on what we can learn from other industries: from paths of teaching through apprenticeship, team dynamics, psihology and even corporate environments.

### Road to seniority

Abstract:

While I will share some examples from my own career, this is not a talk about me. This talk will be heavily based on examples of ideal situation vs reality (theory vs practice), talking about do's and dont's on how to build and improve your career, independently if you already are a senior or not.

I would love that you as attendee participate and share your stories with all of us, as I will leave some time at the end of the talk for a short discussion.

### Preprocessing PHP

Abstract:

PHP as a language can't rapidly follow the needs of the developers: we should look at other languages that decided to build custom DSLs over existing platforms/languages like TypeScript or Elixir. Both languages were born for different reasons, solving different problems and having unique takeaways on developer communities at large.

After a rather short introduction to them, I will cover benefits and pitfalls of these concepts with some examples from our community on how and what would be solved easily with preprocessing of PHP like generics, immutable structures and so on.

There are already some initiatives building upon this idea but they are not being widely recognized and I would love to introduce you to them and some of my work as well (which I have done as proof of concepts).

### Learn by teaching

Abstract:

For most of my career, I have been self taught, exploring new worlds by myself. On the other hand, most of my 'life changing' moments happened when other taught me and some years ago I decided to pay it back.

I started mentoring and teaching individuals and ran a class with a group of developers, sharing back some of my knowledge. It helped me a lot to learn even more, and in this talk I want to share some of what I learned with you.

If you are interested in teaching/mentoring others, I will share some key aspects and hopefully motivate you to start on that road. If you are already teaching/mentoring, I would love to hear more about how you do it!
