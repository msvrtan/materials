### Title:
Learning from others

### Abstract:

As a rather young industry, set on disrupting the world, industry built on life long learning: IT is actually pretty bad in learning from others. For some rather strange reason, we love 'reinventhing the wheel' and dissing 'those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it' ideas.

Some years ago I noticed how much my community (PHP) is reluctant to learn from others: lot of problems we try to solve have been solved for decades in other communities. This is not a trait of my community only, I'we seen it everywhere. 

However, this talk will focus more on what we can learn from other industries: from paths of teaching through apprenticeship, team dynamics, psihology and even corporate environments.


### Additional information:

This is a brand new talk, I plan to do it on one of local meetups in Zagreb in Q2/2019.
