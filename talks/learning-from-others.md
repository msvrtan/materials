### Title:
Learning from others

### Abstract:

As a rather young industry, set on disrupting the world, industry built on life long learning: IT is actually pretty bad in learning from others. For some rather strange reason, we love 'reinventhing the wheel' and dissing 'those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it' ideas.

Some years ago I noticed how much my community (PHP) is reluctant to learn from others: lot of problems we try to solve have been solved for decades in other communities. This is not a trait of my community only, I'we seen it everywhere. 

However, this talk will focus more on what we can learn from other industries: from paths of teaching through apprenticeship, team dynamics, psihology in sports and even corporate environments.

How many of you would feel comfortable being operated by surgeon that just got their degree last month?

If you feel we already learn so well: why do we cycle thru ideas every 5-10 years: age of fat clients, thin clients, fat clients ... did we learn nothing from previous generations? Do we even know why they switched? Do we have anyone to ask what was the reasoning?


Can you even think of any other industry that has only 30% of projects considered a success? Has our safety harness became so good we are so used to failure as default behaviour, embracing it as a way of life?



### Additional information:

This is a brand new talk, I plan to do it on one of local meetups in Zagreb in Q2/2019.
