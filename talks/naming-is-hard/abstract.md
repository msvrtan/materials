### Title:
Naming is hard (discussion)

### Abstract:

They say computer science has 2 hard problems: cache invalidation, naming things and off-by-1 errors. In this session we'll cover naming, in a rather unorthodox way: not as a talk, it's meant as a multiway discussion for a smaller group of people (up to 15-20).

In order to start the discussion I have few examples prepared: from method/class or function/module naming to architecture and design patterns. I will moderate the discussion, but depending on the interest of the attendees and amount of time we have, we might not cover all of the examples.

Key takeaway from this session: share your experiences and learn from other people!


### Additional information:

I would love to do this discussion on ZgPHP in April of 2019 as 1st in the series (of for now 2 sesssions). I'm firm believer that we all can learn more if we shared our experiences and get into discussion instead of doing a one-way type talk: I'we already done 'Nitpicking terminology' in that way and last year I organized my PHPYorkshire talk slot about 'Being a remote developer' to include a 15min panel to discuss it (as I had extra time)
