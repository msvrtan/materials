### Ideas

DONE:
 - stuck? wanna give back?
 - rewarding
 - sharing knowledge - pays back by others sharing their knowledge back
 - silly questions
	- juniors due to lack of experience have the craziest questions
 	- exposes low understanding on things we didnt know we dont know
 	- have you ever tried x or y or z which you never heard of
 - raising others, shortening their path so they can investigate other things and then teach you back
 	- Tomo @ commit
 - yes, you can learn from juniors as well
 - definition of bad code
 - million of ideas on what to talk about
 - organize it with ppl outside of your company (expand instead of talking to ppl you talk to 'daily' and that are 'locked' to 'company way')
 	- ask on social media(s)
 	- local meetup
 - look for people interested in learning instead of ppl forced to do it
 - where:
 	- community spaces, NGOs, office of commerce 
 	- coworking spaces
 	- your company

IN PROGRESS:

TODO:
 - notice priviledge/entitlement on yourself
 - Tomo story of 'how can I ever pay you back' and not understanding that I learn as well
 - add personal part of being self-taught
 - highest/fastest growth when taught by others
