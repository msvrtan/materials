#### Stuck

Have you ever felt stuck at your career? OK this is a very personal question so let me first tell you something about myself

##### PHP

I come from PHP. And this is a Java conference. Yes. 

##### Tomatoes

Now that I opened up myself to jokes & rotten tomatoes ..

##### Graph peak

Did you ever feel your now at your peak and it's just going down from now on ... anyone? can you raise your hands?

##### Different stack

Some people decide to change language, technology or stack .. sometimes cause it pays better, sometimes cause they need new challanges

##### Management

and some people decide to go for management ... but should we as community/company loose all of that great experience & knowledge you have?

#### Paying back

Maybe you want to give back to your community I'we heard lot of people who wanted to pay it back and also advance their carreer by doing open-source, conference speaking, some organize local meetups or conferences. I'we done some of this but decided to go a bit different way these days: I'we decided to teach & mentor other developers and I'm here to share what I learned with you

#### Learn by teaching

My name is Miro Svrtan, some of you might know me as ZgPHP meetup organizer, some of you might know me as WebCamp Zagreb organizer, so I'we been active in this community for quite a long time and by pure luck I found myself teaching ppl...

I'we been a developer for almost 2 decades, mostly doing PHP ;) and let me tell you what I learned by teaching others... hopefully it might inspire some of you to try it out as well

####

So lets start with a quick questionaire, who feels here they are an expert in their framework? Or library? Or language? Can you tell me which framework, you are an expert in? OK, so as I'm not from Java community, can you explain me, why did you pick that one? Like in 2 simple sentences... why not the other one?

#### Communication

So yeah, when you have to explain something to a person that is not biased by all of the technical choices your company did or has no experience in it, it also improves your communication skills...it's easy to communicate to people you have been working with for years but are you really sure you can easily bring on new team members? Or explain to your colleagues some crazy idea of how to try something new? We as developers/engineers love that feel of security, using the same tools we have been using for years but we also do have an urge to try new things (even us old people)... so if you had problems convincing others, is it neccessarily problem in them or in you?

#### Deeper understanding

But this is also a great way to test your knowledge as well ... 


### Doing -> teaching -> knowing

I dont think doing something makes me neccessarily an expert in that something ... I might know what to use, often how to use it but do I really know why?


#### ??

How many of you are teachers or mentors in your company? OK, few hands ... In last 5 years I have been mostly working for remote companies and in companies which hire only seniors ... And I noticed that I do miss on teaching/mentoring others only when I started working with an intern 3y ago when I joined my previous company... I loved it! I had the time and resources to work with a smart young person but as he was an intern after 6months he had to continue his studies and I started noticing again that I do miss that part. 

On one of the local meetups, an attendee was talking how it's hard to learn and find a company that will give them a chance, at a time when every company needs people. Companies expect some knowledge already and we started talking ... I'we decided to spend 2-3h a week mentoring him and it was really great: I wasnt tied by current work as we would be working on completely different things, giving me open hands to go outside of my comfort zone as well: not just in teaching but in the topics as well. That didnt mean I picked something I'm not knowledgable in technical sense but wasnt dependant on what I work on for 8 hours a day and have to think about all the possible consequences of each decision: we picked to build a simple app and I was able to not spend too much time outside of our monday afternoon slot on it.

#### Boundaries

And this is rather important: try to create some boundaries. Unfortunately we didnt start like that and we would ourselves sometimes spending 4-5 hours, which was neither good for me or him: after 8 hours of work, I was really eager to share so much and for him, after 8 hours of work it would become too much to absorb.


#### Pacing

I had to learn to pace myself. 


#### Planning

But I also had to do some planning. Proper agile style planning. Not deadline driven agile waterban scrumfall. 


#### In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable. Dwight D. Eisenhower

While I had some idea on what we would do in next few sessions, sometimes just the next one and sometimes for next three, I'we started understanding the value of planning vs the value of plans. Yes, sometimes we would be done with something quicker and spent extra time on chit-chatting about different things, sometimes what I tought would fit one session was actually 2 of them. And I'we also started valueing having clear boundaries: few months in we decided to limit our sessions to 2 hours which we both found good enough. That way I feel we both were eager for the next session, looking forward to it instead of thinking 'oh no next deathmarch is coming'

#### Plans vs planning

While it would have been better if we had clear plans, what would happen when they get derailed? When I estimated wrong.. how much time should I spend estimating vs doing just in order to avoid the possible problems ... I'm not sure that whole journey would be enjoyable for me as it would bring unwanted stress and remember, I did this in my spare time.

So our plans were: we will meet on Mondays afternoon, from 6PM to 8PM, if he had any questions prepared we would discuss them first, if they take too much time, that means that was more important than what I planned but that BROUGHT MORE VALUE than my original plans did. 


#### In years time..

Throught that year I noticed how much I enjoyed teaching and even decided to give educating others a try: as the first mentoring was winding down, I was looking into trying it a bit differently: gather a group of 2-3 people for similar setup where we could also try group excercises as well: I think culture is very important thing and by having multiple people not only I can help more people in the same time but they can learn how to help each other. I'we posted on Facebook that I'm looking for few people to mentor, if they are interested they should ping me. And they pinged me !! Like 11 or 12 of them .. OMG, what should I do now ... well, what if instead of unstructured small group, I do bit more planned sessions, long term workshops where we would not only go thru technical details, coding and stuff but the culture of a team: and 9 of them were interested. 

I knew not all 9 would survive the course, but 3 of them had to quit due to illness issues in their families and one just couldnt find the time anymore. I cant say if they were just trying to be polite and skipped saying 'You suck' but I was ready for the course not to be for everyone ... and that is something you have to be aware: it doesnt mean you are a bad teacher, just some people have different priorities and when everything is on volontary bases, you do want to keep the interested ones in. I think trainings, where you have people who are there cause someone told them they have to be there and they are not interested can be bit hard to maintain: as they might get the whole group demotivated, they can become destructive or something: I had none of those issues. Everyone wanted to be there.

The whole course took 11-12 saturday mornings over 5 months, from 9AM to 2PM with lot of breaks. I love breaks.


#### Breaks

I actually forced myself to have a 5-10 minute break every 45-60 minutes. This way, people who dont know each other get to mingle, chat, talk, exchange ideas and create those very important connections between themselves. On the other hand, they all work full time, have families, some have children, Saturdays had to have balance of learning and fun if you want to keep people motivated...


#### Motivation

I'm not a carismatic person so motivating people is really not my strong suite. But making learning fun is not that hard and can bring great results in!


#### Retrospectives

Few Saturdays in, we started with retrospectives: something none of them have ever seen before. Something I have not seen done properly in lot of teams: reflecting on what was good, what needed to improve and exchange ideas since the last Saturday, sometimes I gave some homework and we would reflect on that, we would talk and often hear they implmeneted in their worklife something they leaned here. At the end of Saturday we would do a quick retro of the day. Great feedback for me to know what to improve, what to do better and for others to share what they found interesting, needed ...


#### Planning vs plans

Well, with a group of people. having timeboxed, planning was nice but plans were dropped quickly. At the end of the course, we didnt go thru everything I wanted but I feel I gave them enough to learn and ask for more...


#### Project

We decided as part of a course to build a product. An imaginary product. And that flopped, from people leaving the group as we started with 3 teams of 3 people to leaving juniors to 'think what the app should do and how to implement it'. I'we been previously burned by the same mentality at work but I tought now that they have something fun to do, something they are interested (as they decided themselves what to build) I figured out:


#### You can't leave kids alone.

Please understand, most of them were juniors, not all of them and I tought they could organize themselves. They are not kids and I'm not a nanny: but in all fairness, that was actually exactly what we were. You cant build a team of people who need guidance as they dont know what to do and how, when ... every team needs someone who will help them on theirway, a person with experience ... how many of you could land a spaceshuttle if you were in it and it's crashing down on Earth? Just punching in random keys on the shuttle might work in some percentage of the cases but do you really want to launch 100 of them with 5 people in each who have never been in a shuttle just to figure out which 1 or 2 will survive by pressing right random keys?


#### Don't mistake luck for smarts

None of us is perfect and pressing random keys is not a trait of smart people but a trait of lucky ones. @TODO: ASK WHY ARE WE DOING THAT STILL?


#### Ppl out of your company

So some of you might be asking themselves, I learned all of that from 9 to 5 .... great ... I do hope it wasnt forced on you and that it wasnt too painfull ;)

If you start working with people who are not from your company, even if we skip the part where you will increase number of people you know, you can get lot of really valuable views and opionions from people who work of different projects than you,come from different backgrounds, who work in different companies, who can share what they know with you..


#### Silly questions

And yes, they will have silly questions. 


#### 'There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers'

From day one I was telling them 'THERE ARE NO STUPID QUESTIONS, ONLY STUPID ANSWERS'. It's really important to build the culture of trust. Never ever ever make fun of someones question or treat them as stupid ones:

1) maybe you have not explained it well enough
2) it's a teachable moment cause one person being brave enough might mean more were not brave enough to ask
2) it will make people not eager to ask and you will miss opportunity to grow as a teacher on places where you did screw up

#### How do I run that Java code in browser?

Maybe they dont know the difference between Java & Javascript, maybe they reffered to java applets ... maybe who knows what .. you can loose their trust and openess very easily .. 


#### Trust

and trust is hard to obtain but easy to loose


#### Bad code (descriptions)

Avoid trying to reference something as bad, your view of what is bad and their view of what is bad can be completely different. As you dont come from same codebase, culture, type of projects etc... when you say things like 'I write bad code too' might be misinterpreted: trust me, I got into a situation where someone wrote extremly bad code and got back with 'yeah it was a quick thing and you said yourself sometimes bad code is OK' to me only figuring out that my expectation of what is bad code is much higher then what they consider 


#### Sharing is caring

There is a really nice phenomena I noticed with some people: cause you shared your knowledge with them, they are much more willing to share with you and share with others. You tought them sharing is caring and they absorbed it as normal cultural behaviour. 


#### T***

I actually learned a lot from some of my mentee's as well. As there path to learning got shorter, they could spend that extra time learning different things and then teaching back. For instance, few months ago one of my mentees decided to do a talk on local meetup group about writing good commit messages. While I already knew lot about it, was aware of it's importance, it was a good kick in the behind for me to improve my commit messages and it has taken a great effect on my daily work too: so yes, by shortening other peoples path to success you can learn a lot from them too.


#### Speaking ideas

Another thing I noticed, as I was working with people from so different backgrounds, it gave me a better insight into what topics might be interesting for me & others to hear. Just for this 3 months now I have 3 new talks to prepare. I'm not a better speaker than others, I'm not smarter than others, I'm not better in any way, I only have a better understand of what people could/would be interested to hear. And I often talk with other speakers and lot of them, who in my opinion have much so much to talk about, dont have the idea what to share with others.


#### Tips & tricks

I hope I got some of you interested, just as we are coming to the end, for those who might be interested in how to start, where to find people or place:

##### Ask on social networks

This will include lot of people who you are not directly connected to you, by others liking or retweeting, network effect should get to some of those people that need and want to be helped.

##### Local meetups

I'm pretty sure there are local meetups where they will gladly give you 2-3 minutes or even more for a lightning talk where you can tell people about your plans and invite them to join you


### Where?

If you decide to mentor just one person, your office can be good enough ...

For those interested in teaching larger group,

#### Public places like Mama

If you are coming from Zagreb, there is Mama in Preradoviceva where you can ask them for a space .. they do have a busy schedule but I'm sure you can find some slot

#### Coworking places

Maybe a coworking place, I'm pretty sure they would be interested in helping you out

#### Your company

Maybe your company has a spare conference room you can use...


#### Another company

Or maybe you can ask around and find another company who would be happy to help you out with giving you their conference room for free to use... if you are willing to maybe take on somebody from their company it would probably even improve your chances

#### Ask around

I'm pretty sure people from the community can help you with ideas. Not only people from your own language community.... other communities as well


#### Recap

So just a quick recap

If you decided to take on mentoring one person, that can be as little as 2h a week, maybe 2-3 times a month ... as much as you can afford ... but please keep in mind some continuity is needed, you cant do it 2h every 6 months ... 

if you are interested in helping multiple people, you can do it in the afternoon for 3-4 hours or weekend for 5-6 hours, but those take some extra time to prepare, maybe start with one person first .. for me it was sometimes as low as 10 minutes and on few occassions it was few hours as I wanted to do some dry runs .. but it shouldnt be more than an hour in general ... again, you can do it 2-3 times a month..


It pays back... I know not all of you can find a lot of free time, having busy lifes but maybe you can ask your employer to sponsor it by saying it counts as working hours .. they could benefit from it too


But at the end of the game: It's you as a person/developer will grow and learn new things!
