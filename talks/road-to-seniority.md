### Title:
Road to seniority

### Abstract:

While I will share some examples from my own career, this is not a talk about me. This talk will be heavily based on examples of ideal situation vs reality (theory vs practice), talking about do's and dont's on how to build and improve your career, independently if you already are a senior or not.

I would love that you as attendee participate and share your stories with all of us, as I will leave some time at the end of the talk for a short discussion.



### Additional information:

This is a brand new talk.
