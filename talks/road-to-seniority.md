### Title:
Road to seniority

### Abstract:

The road to seniority is an ill defined path - do you consider yourself a senior, do others consider you, and by what definition? Lets lay out the foundations of what defines a senior and let's walk through examples of ideal situations vs reality (theory vs practice). What are some do's and dont's when improving a software career and how does one really become a senior?

Let's not make this talk a one way street - I'd love that you as attendee participate and share your stories with all of us, as I will leave some time at the end of the talk for a short discussion.


### Additional information:

This is a brand new talk.
