### Title:
User: design discussion

### Abstract:

As an example of software architecture most of us are familiar with: `Users`, lets look at some patterns and pitfalls of them. There is no right answer, as it does depend on your particular use case but idea behind this session is to expand our knowledge beyond 'your mileage may vary' and 'it depends' that have become so often a generic answer to so many questions.

This session is not meant as a talk but as a discussion: it's curcial that you as attendee get involved and help in the discussion: whether it's you asking questions, offering ideas or your use cases and solutions. Initial examples will be prepared by me and I will moderate the discussion to keep it on track and avoid some needless bikeshedding ;)

Key takeaway from this session: share your experiences and learn from other people!


### Additional information:

I would love to do this discussion on ZgPHP in May or June of 2019, as 2nd in the series (for now I have only 2 topics for sessions). 


### Notes:

Examples like:

 - naming (users, clients, members, subscribers, visitors, atendees ...) #byZoka
 - separating authentication logic from domain logic (auth user vs app user and his profile) #byZoka
 - "userless" and stateless authentication and authorization implementation (e.g. for machine to machine authentication, OAuth2) #byZoka
 - Outsourcing authentication (E.g. social login or Firebase auth) #byZoka
 - discuss Smyfony auth approach with loadByUsername & getUser #byZoka
