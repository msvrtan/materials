### Title:
Promise of a generation

### Abstract:

While 'my generation' was promised life on Mars, robots and flying cars by these days, this talk will cover more short-term promises to revolutionize our industry: from NoSQL, blockchain to artificial inteligence as some of the examples.

In this talk we will look at some of successfull and floopped 'revolutionary' ideas in the past, reflect on them and look for patterns, traits and connections to current ones.


### Additional information:

This is a brand new talk.
