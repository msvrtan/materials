### Title:
Where's my flying car? The promise of a generation

### Abstract:

My generation was promised life on Mars, robots and flying cars by these days, but let's focus on more short-term promises to revolutionize our industry: from NoSQL and big data, to blockchain, cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence! Have some of these ideas been successful or have they failed?

Let's look at some of the patterns, traits and connections between all of these and compare them to the successful and flopped 'revolutionary' ideas of the past.


### Additional information:

This is a brand new talk.
