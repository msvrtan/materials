# Road to seniority V2




## Intro

Welcome! Thank you for the introduction, it's so nice to see you all. I'm a bit rusty, I havent been speaking for 4 years , please excuse me if I seem nervous cause I'am .


## Helmet guy wall

While I spent most of my life breaking walls with using my head as a battering ram, most of my growth came from learning from others. I'm almost certain it's 80/20 where I spent 20% of my time learning from others and it made 80% of my knowledge.

I built this talk around what I would loved I heard when I started my career and I want to give you some actionable tips and things to work on. I'll mention topics like learning, culture, attitude, mythical 10x developer and so on.


## 

Before going further, I'm coming from a different background then you, I did different life choices than you, different life things happened to me. I'm a privileged 40ish year old white guy that had his first computer in 7th grade, I dont have a family to take care of, undiagnosed ADHD and I'm a workaholic. I will try to make all of my advices actionable and sensible but I understand that not everyone is in that place in life where they can afford to be better.


## Lumberjack story

Some of you might be in a place where they think they dont have the time or energy to be better. Let me tell you a story of lumberjack that had no time to sharpen their axe. Can you imagine lumberjack that is so overwhelmed so pressured by others that they cant stop and sharp the axe. They have to use dull axe. And they are not aware of what they are doing. They are yelling "There is a whole forest in front of me, those people are waiting for products of my labour". Do you find it funny?

## 

This is the most common excuse I hear from developers when I ask them where are the tests. "There is a jira full of tickets in front of me, frontend wants endpoints, project managers want landing pages I cant stop to write tests". This is how you save time short term but loose long term. And every moment later, writing tests makes less sense when you spent hours debuging as you have invested so much time in putting ducktape everywhere.


I do agree, if you dont know a thing about testing, doing it on a deadline might not be the smartest move. But hey, do we teach all lumberjacks how to sharpen their axe or we just show them a forest and say go? Yes, I strongly believe in personal responsability for your career. It's yours and only yours to manage. 

##

That is why I decided to help you all a bit by doing a 'Road to seniority' talk. For all of you that know nothing about me, I founded ZgPHP and was a co-founder of WebCamp Zagreb, I've been in the industry for about 20years. I love PHP so much that I travelled the world sharing my experiences with others: I spoke in New York, Portland, Miami, Amsterdam, Lisbon, Singapore, Sofia, Zagreb, Verona, Poland, Prague, Belgium, Berlin.

I'm very passionate about my work. I love building good products as much as using them. I want my work to be amazing, which it's not always the result but I strive for excellence not perfection. This is the main reason I love working in product companies and not agencies: I need the focus and time to learn and understand the product.

@TODO: degordian petak 

I've been running my own company for last 10 years. Mostly for the freedom it gives me.

## Hardware

When I was employed, I got a desktop and needed a laptop. I suggested one that was around 2,5 avg Croatian salaries, we should buy a very good one if I'm moving away from desktop. They said it is too much and that I can keep the desktop and find a cheaper laptop.

I moved to another company and wanted Mac: I was told no way, it's not supported by our IT. And I was suggested to get one of the laptops from a compensation with some company. I had to fight to be able to pick a laptop from anywhere. 

That was last piece of equipment I didnt pick myself. Some of the things I picked prooved to be a catastrophic piece of shit, not gonna name the company but it's abbriviated HP.

## use full potential of IDE

I dont have the energy, patience, time or nerves to handle shitty equipment. In order to be good, I need to run IDE with 20 plugins over large codebases, with bunch of dockers running not wasting time on running circles around obstacles that money can easily solve.

@throw money


## learn keyboard shortcuts

Do you want to be faster and better? Learn keyboard shorcuts and force yourself to use them. I didnt believe in them until I started pairing up with a colleague who was a master at them: when I saw what he does in seconds usually takes me minutes and frustrates me to hell I decided I must learn those.

Mouse is root of all evil for productivity ;))

DX, developer experience is a quality of life matter and means a lot


## 10X developer

The mythical 10x developer. Any of you here? So I'm the only one? Nah, you are just modest. And OK, I'm not really 10x...


I see lot of misunderstanding of the topic, I agree it was abused a lot but the idea is not that you produce 10 times more then the other person but that you bring 10 times more value.

## MVP - more valuable player


 What is value? Build an important feature or squash a terrible bug.
Do you have a lot of bugs that are creating big problems? Take them on. Take the one that has most impact, not the hardest or easiest to solve. Dont go for quality, quantity, challenge but for IMPACT


Suggest improvements. Be the change you want to see. 



Your team is not writing tests? Learn how to do it and teach others later. 

You are not using phpstan or psalm? When you go to work tomorrow: add it. Learn it. 

be more valuable player for the team and product.chunks of time (<10%) dont ask for permission, it's better to ask for forgiveness. 


When you are doing something for the first time, document it. It's enough to just write down what you did, copy/paste in links where you found it. It will be a good reference to you and possibly others when they have to look into it.

When you are doing something for 10th time automate it. if you have to do something often, make a script and set up a cron to run it. Can you imagine setting up your local environment buy just running few shellscripts (@TODO give my stepX.sh example)


If you cant automate it write a run book. (@TODO example of how to set up new microservice)

If you see a lot of unreviewed pull requests, review them. Become best reviewer in the team.

If you see someone struggling, help them out. They dont have to be in your expertise but sometimes just being a rubber duck helps.




## Have a can do attitude

brazilian accounting?

I have been learning how to work with twilio past 3 months. I learned javascript and typescript, worked in react with redux. I'm not a full stack developer. There was a need for it and I picked it up. 


Frano vs Niksa

I was in charge of technical part of interview for one of the clients and I joined second round of meetings. We chatted for about half an hour on what they did, what were their biggest accomplishments and fails, went thru some theoretical questions where I saw person was nervous. I like to see how people think so I gave them a rather simple coding challenge I picked on codility. It's not fizzbuzz but I dont think it was much more complex. Visibly nervous? Yes. In panic mode? No. OK, it was a no go so I asked them to send it in after the interview. I got 'Not sure when will I have time' and 'I'm really busy'. OK can you send it in day or two? Started putting out excuses.

2 minutes after the interview I took that challenge, sent it to one of my teammates that was a junior/mid at the time and told him if he would have time this week to solve it. He came back 20 minutes later with 'would this work?'. 

That is a good example of a 'can do attitude'. Think of things coming to you as challenges and be a small kid: enjoy them.

Dont have a 'can do attitude' so you would kiss ass. Do it for the product, for the team, even for yourself. Expect nothing in return. 

## Bad example of can do attitude


But be aware there are bad example of 'can do attitude' where you take over somebody elses duties cause they are incompetent or company is not well organized. If you start fixing peoples printers better then the person who is in charge of it, everybody will call you. 


@TODO Ghost example of wordpress
Will I now become a full stack developer? No. Client was in process of discovery as we are a new team, now that we know our needs and wants we will get new team mates who are much better in it than me.

Unless interested, if there is a missing position or role in the company for something upcoming, be happy to get in temporarily but before confirming get them to tell you when is someone picking that up. Did they open that position already? Will they outsource it? Think twice if you start hearing lot's of future plans and maybes.


## You dont renovate rented appartment

I fell few times in the mode to 'fix companies'. I quit one of my jobs after trying to do miracles to fix things out. I was shouting at CEO cause there was an issue on spending 25EUR's on keyboard for one of the developers. When I told this story on one of my interviews with a foreign company they told me 'there is a glass jar in kitchen with about 500EURs in it, whatever you need just go and buy it. Return change with the payment receipt into the jar and office manager will scan and post all the receipts on internal board so other can get an idea if they need it to '

Never ever try to fix company if your name is not on the owners list. You dont rent an appartment and then fix all the shit that owners dont care about: you go and find another one.

## Be adaptable not abusable

Design story.

I spoke to few friends that have a client that comes EVERY day with what needs to be done at 3 or 4PM. And it all has to be done for tomorrow. I will help but if we have defined nine to five on the third day at 5PM you would get a 'cya tomorrow'.

When does tasks lend on my desk, I would clearly communicate, that it will be done tomorrow.

Look, I'm adaptable, not abusable.



## be hirable


no fear of interview

nervous yes

I interviewed a person that has been working in current company from day 1: started on the bottom and became CTO 10 or 15 years later. Extremly passionate person, very knowledgable in lot of things for that business but it's a bit of a specific one. We could barely offer them a junior position. I'm scared what will happen with that company when they leave but if they have not gotten part of the company by now, it's owners fault. 

But they are hard to hire: who wants to go from a CTO paid position in a small company to a junior salary?? 

do not repeat one year fifteen times


## Jack of all trades is a master of none

But you know jack of all trades is a master of none right?




## Quality vs quantity: 

your money comes from quality, companies from quantity. Be niche in banking vs building cms. Person specialized for developing banking software will make more money then person building content management systems: there is a bigger value and risk, knowledge is niche while rare companies have CMS as core of their business and it's very commoditized this days. Yes, it will be easy to find a job cause there are lots of companies but that also means incomes will not be amazing.


## Strategy vs tactics


First learn what it is, I struggled for it for a long time.


Strategy is the overall plan or approach that you take to achieve a goal. It is the big picture, and it should be based on a deep understanding of your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

Tactics are the specific actions that you take to implement your strategy. They are the details of how you will achieve your goal, and they should be flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions.

Strategy:
- figure out what you are interested in. I like solving business problems. I love building products people around me use. I love hardware. The idea of pressing a button on my phone and light turns on is AMAZING.
- how to learn it? yourself, friend mentor, intern in a company


Tactics:
- interested in: map out your passions, reduce unrealistic ones (I guess becoming a footballer in 30s is not realistic but rocket scientist might  be)
- if you are going in yourself, youtube, udemy, coursera, brilliant might be amazing resources
- if you have someone in the industry to get you running is amazing 
- if you want to learn the most, find companies in the industry and talk to them. If they are not looking for junior possitions, they might be open to part time interning (or if you can afford go and be an intern). Show them you are enthusiastic and passionate about the topic

## if you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room

## life long learning

I found out very interesting thing about German culture from a friend: they think that after school there is no need for learning ???

## I learn all the time

I have been doing technical due dilligence for the client last weeks. I have never done it.

## audible, blinkist,yt as sources of learning

## My WIP:

- improve writing skills to be better in writting documentation
- how to collaborate with multiple teams
- be positive
- write task then do it
- write notes for everything


## PHP is dead

## learn other languages 
- I didnt ... I focused too much on one
- beware of 'jack of all trades, master of none'

## I learn in my spare time

## overtime

I understand it's hard to find time to learn but I have very rarely worked overtime. I always used my spare time to learn not work for the company/client/boss. I hear of people working 10-12 hours in Zagreb, coming home exhausted... that is not a life.

I spoke to few people about this topic and they all said that they would not turn off their brain at 5PM but they would rarely work on company things then: it was time for pet projects, passions, learning.

I have friend who worked as network engineer and is married to a programmer and she said 'you programmers are crazy, do you see me coming home and playing with cisco router?? '


## have mentors

Find people in front of you to be your mentors and coaches and you should mentor and coach people behind you.

I had a pleasure of being one of few foreign speakers on a conference in Poland where I met some amazing people and one of them was Michelangelo van Dam who got me into testing back in 2014.

I have a 9 year old younger brother that is both my mentor and mentee: we push each other a lot.

I'm happy to see few of my mentees in the crowd as well

## surround yourself with people that will push you forward

## long term 

I organized ZgPHP for about 6 years (please dont kill me if my math is wrong) and I organized first 3 WebCamps. I didnt do it for the fame. I didnt do it for marketing. I did it cause I wanted to have that. I did it for myself.

I never had any intentions but enjoying it. But those things changed my life. This is my 3rd job in 7 years that is connected to people in this room. I shared office with people I meet here. Like literally ment them in this room. I was so happy when I found out we are doing Mama cause this room means so much to me

## too shy?

I have gone to symfony meetup in Helsinki and said hi to no one. I go to Tinel meetup in Split and say hi to those few people I know from before. I'm not extrovert and I'm not outgoing but when I get on this stage, I become someone else. It gives me power and strength to talk to others cause now people now a bit about me and we have topics to talk about.


Be active in community. I understand speaking might not be for everyone but you can become an open source contributor or help organize meetups. Find interests outside of your daily job. Learn another language. Do them cause you enjoy them, cause you want to do them and years later it might pay back 10 fold.

You have to push yourself. Out of the comfort zone

## Agile 

Agile is about people and companies being adaptable not about big changes. This is the misconception I had for years. No business will decide one day to transition from being a bakery to being a car manufacturer. 


## Lack of planning 

As well, agile doesnt mean there is no planning. That is where you implement methodologies like sprint or kanban...



## Log time


I started logging time 14 years ago for myself, I dont share it with anyone, it started as a need for tracking time as I tend to get lost. I still suck at predictions and estimates but at least I can take a look and see how much time I spent preparing this talk. Of course, it will not cover all the time as I would also be walking my dog and thinking about it and so on.

## you cant improve things you dont measure

## last but not least: always underpromise and overdeliver

I go and understand the problem.
I come and ask hard questions
I dont start until I understand what I'm doing

that is how I score points with clients.



SKIP?
## Write notes & todos

Instead of remembering things, write them down. Yes, I hated the idea of writing things down too but at some point in time, life just became too much to handle: I would either drive to the shop and think 'dont forget to buy tomatoes,dont forget to buy tomatoes' or I would come out of shop with everything but that. Mind is precious resource, use it for creative things not for remembering 


SKIP?
## Throw money at problems

Delegate as much as you can. If you are a part of the team, delegate cool and exciting tasks to others and keep shitty ones for your self. Give what are boring tasks for you to colleagues that find it exciting: you as mid always have some tasks that would be interesting to juniors or someone who has not worked on that part of project. Be creative and people will come to you for more. Rasmus

I had a situation when one of the projects kept growing like crazy: we had to buy more and more hardware. And each server was in a range of my jearly salary. I kept trying to find ways to make things more performant when all I had to do is say 'we need 1 more server, get it'. I was saving my clients money and their CEO asked me later: who gave you that permission? You were making decisions on my behalf




##  Thank you



 


WHY? HOW? WHAT?
