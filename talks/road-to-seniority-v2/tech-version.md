# Road to seniority V2




## Intro

Welcome! Thank you for the introduction, it's so nice to see you all. I'm a bit rusty, I havent been speaking for 4 years , please excuse me if I seem nervous cause I'am .


## Helmet guy wall

While I spent most of my life breaking walls with using my head as a battering ram, most of my growth came from learning from others. I'm almost certain it's 80/20 where I spent 20% of my time learning from others and it made 80% of my knowledge.

I built this talk around what I would loved to hear when I started my career and I want to give you some actionable tips and things to work on. I'll mention topics like learning, culture, attitude, mythical 10x developer and so on.


## 

Before going further, I'm coming from a different background then you, I did different life choices than you, different life things happened to me. I'm a privileged 40ish year old white guy that had his first computer in 7th grade, I dont have a family to take care of and I'm a workaholic. I will try to make all of my advices actionable and sensible but I understand that not everyone is in that place in life where they can afford to be better.


## Lumberjack story

Some of you might be in a place where they think they dont have the time or energy to be better. Let me tell you a story of lumberjack that had no time to sharpen his axe. Can you imagine lumberjack that is so overwhelmed so pressured by others that they cant stop and sharped the axe. They have to use dull axe. And they are not aware of what they are doing. They are yelling "There is a whole forest in front of me, those people are waiting for products of my labour". Do you find it funny?

## 

This is the most common excuse I hear from developers when I ask them where are the tests. "There is a jira full of tickets in front of me, frontend wants endpoints, project managers want landing pages I cant stop to write tests". This is how you save time short term but loose long term. And every moment later, writing tests makes less sense when you spent hours debuging as you now have invested in putting some ducktape.


I do agree, if you dont know a thing about testing, doing it on a deadline might not be the smartest move. But hey, do we teach all lumberjacks how to sharpen their axe or we just show them a forest and say go? Yes, I strongly believe in personal responsability for your career. It's yours and only yours to manage. 

##

That is why I decided to help you all a bit by doing a 'Road to seniority' talk. For all of you that know nothing about me, I founded ZgPHP and was a co-founder of WebCamp Zagreb, I've been in the industry for about 20years. I love PHP so much that I travelled the world sharing my experiences with others: I spoke in New York, Portland, Miami, Amsterdam, Lisbon, Singapore, Sofia, Zagreb, Verona, Poland, Prague, Belgium, Berlin.

I'm very passionate about my work. I love building good products as much as using them. I want my work to be amazing, which it's not always the result but I strive for excellence not perfection. This is the main reason I love working in product companies and not agencies: I need the focus and time to learn and understand the product.

I've been running my own company for last 10 years: @TODO budget for hardware, travel, ..

## Hardware

When I was employed, I got a desktop and needed a laptop. I suggested one that was around 2 avg Croatian salaeris, we should buy a very good one if I'm moving away from desktop. They said it is too much and that I can keep the desktop and find a cheaper laptop.

I moved to another company and wanted Mac: I was told no way, it's not supported. And I was suggested to get one of the laptops from a compensation with some company. I had to fight to be able to pick a laptop from anywhere. 

That was last piece of equipment I didnt pick myself. Some of the things I picked prooved to be a catastrophic piece of shit, not gonna name the company but it's abbriviated HP.

## use full potential of IDE

I dont have the energy, patience, time or nerves to handle shitty equipment. In order to be good, I need to run IDE with 20 plugins over large codebases, with bunch of dockers running not wasting time on running circles around obstacles that money can easily solve.

## learn keyboard shortcuts

Do you want to be faster and better? Learn keyboard shorcuts and force yourself to use them. I didnt believe in them until I started pairing up with a colleague who was a master at them: when I saw what he does in seconds usually takes me minutes and frustrates me to hell I decided I must learn those.

Mouse is root of all evil for productivity ;))

## 10X developer

The mythical 10x developer. Any of you here? So I'm the only one? Nah, you are just modest. And OK, I'm not really 10x...

I see lot of misunderstanding of the topic, I agree it was abused a lot but the idea is not that you produce 10 times more then the other person but that you bring 10 times more value. What is value? Build an important feature or squash a terrible bug.

Suggest improvements. Be the change you want to see. Your team is not writing tests? Learn how to do it and teach others later. You are not using phpstan or psalm? When you go to work tomorrow: add it. Learn it. For smaller chunks of time (<10%) dont ask for permission, it's better to ask for forgiveness. Do you have a lot of bugs that are creating big problems? Take them on. Take the one that has most impact, not the hardest or easiest to solve.


When you are doing something for the first time, document it. It's enough to just write down what you did, copy/paste in links where you found it. It will be a good reference to you and possibly others when they have to look into it.

When you are doing something for 10th time automate it. if you have to do something often, make a script and set up a cron to run it. Can you imagine setting up your local environment buy just running few shellscripts (@TODO give my stepX.sh example)


If you cant automate it write a run book. (@TODO example of how to set up new microservice)

If you see a lot of unreviewed pull requests, review them. Become best reviewer in the team.

If you see someone struggling, help them out. They dont have to be in your expertise but being a rubber duck helps.

## Have a can do attitude

Frano vs Niksa

I was in charge of technical part of interview for one of the clients and I joined second round of meetings. We chatted for about half an hour on what they did, what were their biggest accomplishments and fails, went thru some theoretical questions where I saw they were nervous. I like to see how people think so I gave them a rather simple coding challenge I picked on codility. It's not fizzbuzz but I dont think it was much more complex. Visibly nervous? Yes. In panic mode? No. OK, it was a no go so I asked them to send it in after the interview. I got 'Not sure when will I have time' and 'I'm really busy'. OK can you send it in day or two? Started putting out excuses.

2 minutes after the interview I took that challenge, sent it to one of my teammates that was a junior/mid at the time and told him if he would have time this week to solve it. He came back 20 minutes later with 'would this work?'. 

That is a good example of a 'can do attitude'. Think of things coming to you as challenges and be a small kid: enjoy them.



## Bad example of can do attitude


Dont have a 'can do attitude' so you would kiss ass. Do it for the product, for the team, even for yourself. Expect nothing in return. 

But be aware there are bad example of 'can do attitude' where you take over somebody elses job cause they are incompetent or company is not well organized. If you start fixing peoples printers better then the person who is in charge of it, everybody will call you. 

Unless interested, if there is a missing position or role in the company for something upcoming, be happy to get in temporarily but before confirming get them to tell you when is someone picking that up. Did they open that position already? Will they outsource it? Think twice if you start hearing lot's of future plans and maybes.

## Jack of all trades is a master of none

@TODO
Quality vs quantity: your money comes from quality, companies from quantity. Be niche in banking vs building cms


## Strategy vs tactics



Strategy is the overall plan or approach that you take to achieve a goal. It is the big picture, and it should be based on a deep understanding of your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

Tactics are the specific actions that you take to implement your strategy. They are the details of how you will achieve your goal, and they should be flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions.

Hunger: what is your strategy to beat it?


INTERNAL:
- be strategical and tactical
- give actionable advice

WHY? HOW? WHAT?

## audible, blinkist,yt as sources of learning

## strive for excellence
- first working version of the code is called PoC and is far away from production ready


## when starting
- pick larger company, agency vs product is not crucial


## be hirable

## golden handcuffs

## if you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room

## PHP is dead

## Diversity is important team balance

You dont want to be in senior only teams cause someone needs to do simple tasks as well ... 

Team of single minded people is just a person with many hands

## If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together


- Log time!
- Stedio pare drugima (uzeo na sebe odgovornost umjesto da trazim resurse)
- Financijska nepismenost
- Agile is about being adaptable not changes
- Being agile doesnt mean no planning, that is where methodology comes in
- i got fired: lack of team work, crappy code, shitty project, got depressed
- Talk on meetups as a way of meeting other ppl: i’m not a social person, until i put some kind of a hat (pick a role)
- learn to delegate tasks: you can delegate crapy tasks or be loved by delegating good ones
