WHY? HOW? WHAT?

## WHY THIS TALK?

I'm sorry I havent heard it when I started off, it 

## 

## 

## Who am I?

Before giving you advice and tips, lets see if we are a fit.

I love building great products almost as much as I like using them.

##
I'm a workaholic with undiagnosed ADHD.

## Decision fatigue: Sheldon schedules for uncreative things

I tought Sheldon is funny for having weekly dinner schedules
but it took me some time to understand how much time and energy I spend on figuring out what I want to eat.
If you put 200 restaurants in front of me it will take me an hour to figure out what to order.
If you put plain piece of bread and marmelade in front of me I will eat it.
I'm not as picky about food as much as I like to investigate it... 


I wasnt always a morning person but I would always wake up early for hotel breakfasts: just being able to pick multiple things at small quantities means I can try out so many things instead of deciding on one big thing.
I went to a hotel in 2020 and they had a remote buffet where I would tell them what to take: I hated it. 



##
My mind works in creative bursts, I'm unable to consistently work on something for long period of times.
(I sprint, cant pace for marathon)

## Short attentions with hyperfocus 
While I have short attention span, when I focus I go into hyperfocus disregarding all but the target before me. 

Unfortunately I cant schedule creative work :(

## 

I work as remote software engineer in smaller product companies. For the past 10 years I have been working as contractor running my own company helping people build out their products on full time basis.

## Be hireable

In average, I switch clients every 18 months and while it was painful at times I got used to the process:
I know people who are unhappy at current positions
but are scared shitless of an interview since they have not ever interviewed or have not done it in a long time.
I'm not saying there is no value in being loyal to company but I'm not sure how loyal are they to you?
Do you own a part of it? If shit hits the fan, will they sell of their assets or fire people first?

## Be adaptable p1

After about 2years working from home I got cabin fever
and could not motivate my self to work so I decided to rent out an office with my friends.
There was a situation that I havent left my appartment for 2 days straight

Do you like working at home on 3 big screens ?
Practice working on just laptop as it will help you with travelling.
It will empower you to travel, work from home....
