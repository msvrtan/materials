### Title:
Preprocessing PHP

### Abstract:

PHP as a language can't rapidly follow the needs of the developers: we should look at other languages that decided to build custom DSLs over existing platforms/languages like TypeScript or Elixir. Both languages were born for different reasons, solving different problems and having unique takeaways on developer communities at large.

After a rather short introduction to them, I will cover benefits and pitfalls of these concepts with some examples from our community on how and what would be solved easily with preprocessing of PHP like generics, immutable structures and so on.

There are already some initiatives building upon this idea but they are not being widely recognized and I would love to introduce you to them and some of my work as well (which I have done as proof of concepts). 


### Additional information:

This is a brand new talk.
