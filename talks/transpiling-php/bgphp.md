Welcome, 

###

PHP is rather verbose programming language, making it hard to quickly comprehend what a piece of code does. I'm not a proponent of magic either... I love my code to be concise, readable and easy to understand.

###

But PHP as language is written in C, making a barrier for any kind of new feature pretty hard: I, and probably most of you do know, understand and write PHP but have no idea how to do C. This means there is a big void between people who do language and it's users. Each of the groups has different expectations. Core developers often have not done PHP in years..

###

So lets look at the middle ground: transpiling PHP. My name is Miro and I'll be talking about this tonight.
