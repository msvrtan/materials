### Title:
Designing the User

### Abstract:

Every app has some concept of a User, but is it okay to cram up all the info into one entity, or is it better to separate it in their domain entities such as members, employees, visitors? There is no right answer, as it does depend on your particular use case! Let's go above the 'it depends' and 'your milage may vary', and look at some real world use cases!

This session is not meant as a talk but as a discussion: it's crucial that YOU get involved and participate in the discussion: whether it's you asking questions, offering ideas or sharing your use cases and solutions. Initial examples will be prepared by me and I will moderate the discussion to keep it on track and avoid some needless bikeshedding ;)

Key takeaway from this session: share your experiences and learn from other people!


### Additional information:

I would love to do this discussion on ZgPHP in May or June of 2019, as 2nd in the series (for now I have only 2 topics for sessions). 


### Notes:

Examples like:

 - naming (users, clients, members, subscribers, visitors, atendees ...) #byZoka
 - separating authentication logic from domain logic (auth user vs app user and his profile) #byZoka
 - "userless" and stateless authentication and authorization implementation (e.g. for machine to machine authentication, OAuth2) #byZoka
 - Outsourcing authentication (E.g. social login or Firebase auth) #byZoka
 - discuss Smyfony auth approach with loadByUsername & getUser #byZoka
