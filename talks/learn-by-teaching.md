### Title:
Learn by teaching

### Abstract:


#### Version 2 (After some Pim & Zoka suggestions)


Have you ever felt like there is not much more to accoplish in your career? 
-or-
Have you ever felt there are no new challenges and your career is at the peak? 

Do you feel like you received more from the community than you gave back?
-or-
Do you feel like you received more than you gave back and want to even the balance?

While you can always find challenges by switching languages or companies, speak on local meetup or conference, open source your work or help maintain existing ones, I went a different road: decided to become a teacher and a mentor. If you are interested in learning more on how and what, join me for this talk.

I strictly enforce 'There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers' guideline, but the types of simple and sometimes silly questions you get from wondering young minds is just amazing! 

This talk will cover not only what I learned from teaching/mentoring but give you some guidelines how to start, some tips & tricks and show you how easy it can be to set it all up!

#### Version 1


For most of my career, I have been self taught, exploring new worlds by myself. On the other hand, most of my 'life changing' moments happened when other taught me and some years ago I decided to pay it back.

I started mentoring and teaching individuals and ran a class with a group of developers, sharing back some of my knowledge. It helped me a lot to learn even more, and in this talk I want to share some of what I learned with you.

If you are interested in teaching/mentoring others, I will share some key aspects and hopefully motivate you to start on that road. If you are already teaching/mentoring, I would love to hear more about how you do it!


### Additional information:

This is a brand new talk.
