### Title:
Learn by teaching

### Abstract:

For most of my career, I have been self taught, exploring new worlds by myself. On the other hand, most of my 'life changing' moments happened when other taught me and some years ago I decided to pay it back.

I started mentoring and teaching individuals and ran a class with a group of developers, sharing back some of my knowledge. It helped me a lot to learn even more, and in this talk I want to share some of what I learned with you.

If you are interested in teaching/mentoring others, I will share some key aspects and hopefully motivate you to start on that road. If you are already teaching/mentoring, I would love to hear more about how you do it!


### Additional information:

This is a brand new talk.
