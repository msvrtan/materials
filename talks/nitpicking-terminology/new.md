Nitpicking terminology

### 
Dont you hate when you order Coca Cola but get Pepsi?

###
When you are a vegeterian but fish is not meat?

###
or you ask for a beer and they suggest Zuja?

### 
birds milk -> Ornithogalum


###
You might be wondering what the hell I'm talking about, to some of you some or all of the previous examples were 'ha?', some might have found yourself in them and some might completely agree with me :)
To me, terminology is really important details, trying to be sure I'm communicating to others correctly and understanding them correctly too.

###
Some of you domain driven designers in the audience will understand this as an 'ubiquitous language'... but lets put it to a technical/organization level not bussiness domains per se. Or better, lets use the practices of DDD to organize our lives.

###
Let me nitpick some terminology from our professional lifes instead, and lets see some of the caveats and misunderstanding happening.

"Only programmers & drug dealers have users, everyone else has customers." Maybe next time before naming the table 'users' you should sit down and find a better name.

### Full stack developer
################################################################################

Do we have any full stack developers in the house? Can someone tell me what full stack means? Is that a backend + javascipt, backend + frontend or does it include frontend/ops/ui/ux/design/slicing/.... 

So lets say you are looking for some new opportunities and find a job ad saying 'looking for full stack dev' what would you expect?

### Digital rot/corrosion
################################################################################

Just like fruit rots or cars corrode, software does decay too. Just like fruits or cars, it's because of the environmental changes most often:


1) old way of coding
2) old language
3) old hardware

which often force us into hating legacy apps. If we took care of our software as we take care of our car, maintain it, keep it nice & shiny, it would last us much longer.

### Free lunch
################################################################################


Few months ago I heard a comment saying 'people dont understand free food perk. Lot's of them think it's there to keep people 24h a day in the office. No, you have to be aware that eager people join this company, they dont have to be forced to stay, they want to stay. Free lunch helps with cognitive load', how much time does it take you to decided where to go for food/where from order, what to eat... or you can just walk downstairs and eat...

### Smoking
################################################################################

there is no disussion how unhealthy it is but for some really strange reason: it brings ppl together. Usually smokers get separated from the rest of the herd, being a bar or conference, but also opens up some really strange conotations: asking for a ciggarette (help) and people usually respond with kindness

### Bussiness vs tech: the collision
################################################################################

We, programmers/developers/engineers like talking to a computer cause it usually has a logical reponse: from same input giving us same output to lack of human like exceptions. But bussinesses are all about people, being very flexible in how they run and what their goals are. But we p/d/e/, are not. For instance, first time I decided to do pancakes I looked at a recipe and it said: a cup of sugar, a spoon of salt...ok, which spoon, what is a spoon, like is that with a hill or ... but what about cup...I have espresso cups .. I have coffee cups .. I have milk cups ... I even have american style coffee mug


Or look at my last week airport situation ... checking in stops 45 min before flight, boarding ends 20 min before flight ... OK, no funzies this time, I'll be there on time .. 10 mins before flight, boarding doors are still closed... I dont know what happened as airplane was early in coming and was standing there over 2h ... 3h later, next airport, has a last call 45 minutes before flight ... I panicked, ran to find out that well 'last call' means 'boarding'... 5days later, that same airpory, boarding starts an 60 minutes before, 20 minutes earlier boarding has not started ...

I dont know of reasons why this things happened, is it inefficiency or people being stupid...

### Devops engineer
################################################################################


### I find this title to be so funny. Dev-ops is a cultural movement, an idea that developers and operations, work together instead of battling and blaming each other on each issue. It might have grown from it, to describe a new way of thinking, an infrstructure as a code, cloud computing and everything else but have you ever seen an 'agile developer' title? OK, some people will for sure say, yeah but it's about tooling as well? Yeah, and what is Jira?

### privilege
################################################################################


I'm white, male, a product of middle class family, never having to think where is my next meal coming from, holding a european union passport, working in the sector that has tremendous growth and high wages. For years, I have been a judgemental prick, thinking if I suceeded in life, you could have done the same but have decided not to do it. If I ever hurt anyone with my bad behaviour, take my deepest appologies, I'm still learning and I'm far from where I want to be.


I see lot of people not understanding diversity & inclusivity, often hearing that this is predomentantly white male community cause others are not interested in it. My parents tought me that if you want something you have to work hard for it and that 'if you do what you love, you will never work a day in your life'. Not everyone had the privilege's I had and me not understanding the value of privilege is terrible. Thinking that environment doesnt influence your choices in life is just wrong: if I was born
