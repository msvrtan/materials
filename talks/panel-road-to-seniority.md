### Title:
Panel: Road to seniority

### Abstract:

The road to seniority is an ill defined path - do you consider yourself a senior, do others consider you, and by what definition? Lets lay out the foundations of what defines a senior and let's walk through examples of ideal situations vs reality (theory vs practice). What are some do's and dont's when improving a software career and how does one really become a senior?

Let's not make this panel a one way street - we'd love that you as attendee participate and share your stories with all of us, as we will leave some time at the end of the talk for a short discussion.


### Additional information:

Inititally I imagined this as a talk, upon discussion with organizers of PHP Serbia we decided to make it a panel and it was a blast. I hope to do this on other conferences as well, with your help I would pick the most appropriate panelists from conference speakers, organizers and/or locals.
