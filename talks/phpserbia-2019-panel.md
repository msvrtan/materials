### Title:
PANEL: Road to seniority

### Abstract:

We are all aware that 'senior' has different value and meaning from company to company, lets try to lay some foundation: ideas, concepts, terms & expectations that are generally expected. 

Idea behind this panel is to have a whole harted discussion and ask from panelists to share their lessons, stories, experiences & opinions.  We are open to questions and comments, all you have to do is raise your hand and wait for microphone!


Topics:

1 ) Definition of seniority
Any time constraints? (Like minimum X years of experience)
Is it just higher salary or roles/responsabilities change?
Can you define it in one sentence?


2 ) Different definitions based on companies
Can we define some universal expectations?

3 ) Expectations of & from senior position
What does company/team/teammates expect from a senior?
What should a senior expect from company/team/teammates?


4 ) Specialization vs polyglot
In your experience, should people specialize or be generalists? 
Should they focus on specific domain, language, framework?
Any difference for the 'road to seniority' vs being senior?

5 ) Ideal team balance
In your experience, what is ideal balance on the team? (number of ppl, seniors/mids/juniors/interns/..)


6 ) Tips & tricks (or does & donts)
Common issues/misconceptions on the road to seniority?
Any tips/stories of what to do?
Any tips/stories of what not to do?

Guidelines:

I would love to include audience, idea would be to have someone with a mic running around if ppl have any questions/comments, but we should somehow limit the time/number otherwise we might not get too far :) any suggestions

Time restraints on panelists: I know you all are normal ppl but in the heat of the moment I understand some ppl can get too vocal and lets try to keep the discussion flowing: would like a 2 minute limit be enough per answer? Or maybe put some time boundaries on each question?
